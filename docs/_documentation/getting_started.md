  Utility for mocking `XMLHttpRequest`.

  Great for testing. Great for prototyping while your backend is still being built.

  Works in NodeJS and in the browser. Is compatible with [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), [jQuery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery), [Superagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent)
  and probably every other library built on `XMLHttpRequest`. Standard compliant ([http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/](http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/)).
